# Titanic Survival Analysis


In the early hours of the morning of 15 April 1912, the RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean after it struck an iceberg. As part of an independent investigation into the tragedy, you are tasked with analysing the survival logs for passengers aboard the Titanic.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

The purpose of this notebook it to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.


The components of this analysis will include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Data Modeling
- Data Prediction
